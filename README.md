## Installation
If you would like to modify the code, clone the project onto your computer, and run `npm install` in the root directory, in the client directory, and in the server directory.

From the root directory, type `npm start` to start the Express and GraphQL/Apollo servers. The homepage of the application will open in your default browser.

## Heroku

You can then see order history and test the shopping function. When you check out, you will be directed to a test mode Stripe storefront.

For testing purposes, `4242 4242 4242 4242` can be used as the credit card number with any future date for the expiration date and any three digits for the CVC.
